      <h1>Philosophy behind The One Thing habit</h1>
      <p>
        The most successful people are also the most productive. They are the
        ones who can make the most of their available time. They are able to
        accomplish their tasks and achieve outstanding results because they
        always spend as much time as possible with <i>The One Thing</i> that takes them
        the most forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're called to achieve great things if you can honestly say every time
        you think about where you should be, "I need to be right here doing the
        things I'm doing right now."
      </p>
      <p>The <i>focusing question</i> helps with this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first part of the question: "What is The One Thing I Can Do .."
          This will help you focus and figure out what you can do. The emphasis
          here is on being able to do it. The declarative mode is important!
        </li>
        <li>
          The second part is, "..with doing this .." Here it is decided that you
          are just doing something or that it has some lofty, forward-looking
          purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          The third part of the question is, "..will everything else be easier
          or completely unnecessary?" This closure tells you that if you do that
          One Thing, everything else will come easier, or you may have to do it
          unnecessarily
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <i>focusing question</i> is big and specific, for example: What can I do to
        increase my salary by 40% over the next 6 months?
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to ask yourself such questions! This is a really challenging
        goal that is specific as it is tied to a date. Achieving a 40% salary
        rise is very difficult and is a real challenge in 6 months. To answer
        such a question, you need a big answer. Probably something you haven't
        thought of yet. You need to find a solution that you haven't applied
        before.
      </p>
      <p><b>Appropriate habits == Success</b></p>
      <p>
        Habits take time to form, but once they are formed, it is very difficult
        to shape them. This is why <i>Focusing Questions</i> need to be asked many
        times, because it helps us to fix the habits that really move our lives
        forward.
